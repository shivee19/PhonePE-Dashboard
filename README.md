PhonePe Analytics Dashboard: Transaction Performance, Revenue Trends & Payment Failure Insights

An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze PhonePe’s digital transaction ecosystem — covering revenue performance, service-wise contribution, transaction success rate, monthly trends, and failed payment analysis across Insurance, Loans, Money Transfer, and Recharge & Bills.

Short Description / Purpose

The PhonePe Analytics Dashboard is a comprehensive data visualization project built to monitor and evaluate digital payment performance across multiple financial service categories.

It helps stakeholders understand:

Revenue distribution across services

Monthly transaction trends

Payment success vs failure rate

Operational issues causing failed transactions

Category-wise contribution to overall revenue

This dashboard is useful for business analysts, fintech operations teams, and product managers who want data-driven insights into digital payment platforms like PhonePe, Paytm, or Google Pay.

Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Main platform for building interactive dashboards.

📂 Power Query – Used for data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing.

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Created calculated measures such as total amount, success rate, failure rate, category contribution %, monthly KPIs, etc.

📝 Data Modeling – Established relationships between transaction data, service categories, and payment status for cross-filtering.

📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

Data Source

Source: Synthetic fintech transaction dataset modeled on real-world PhonePe-like digital payment operations.

The dataset captures transaction-level data including:

Transaction ID

Service Category

Transaction Amount

Payment Status (Successful / Failed)

Failure Reasons

Date (Monthly trend analysis)

Service Subcategories

The structure closely resembles real operational data used by fintech companies, making it suitable for practical KPI-based business analysis.

Features / Highlights
• Business Problem

Digital payment platforms process millions of transactions daily but often struggle with:

Identifying top revenue-generating services

Monitoring success vs failure rates

Understanding reasons behind failed payments

Analyzes operational failure reasons

Monitors monthly growth patterns

Supports data-driven decision-making in fintech
